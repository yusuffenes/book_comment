<h1>Book And Comment</h1>
<p>This project is an implementation of a system to manage writers, readers, and books using the Motoko programming language, suitable for deployment on the Internet Computer. The system is designed to handle various entities and their interactions within a literary context.</p>

<h4> <a href=https://m7sm4-2iaaa-aaaab-qabra-cai.ic0.app/?tag=2043152986>View Demo</a> <span> · </span> <a href="https://github.com/yusuffenes/book_comment/blob/master/README.md"> Documentation </a> <span> · </span> <a href="https://github.com/yusuffenes/book_comment/issues"> Report Bug </a> <span> · </span> <a href="https://github.com/yusuffenes/book_comment/issues"> Request Feature </a> </h4>

## Features

- **Writer Management**: Writers can add their books to the system along with comments. They have the option to make their identity visible or remain anonymous.
- **Reader Engagement**: Readers can select books, provide feedback, and choose whether their preferences and feedback are visible.
- **Book Catalog**: A collection of books is maintained, each associated with a writer (if not anonymous) and comments from both writers and readers.
- **Feedback System**: Readers can leave feedback on books, contributing to a community-driven review system.

## Data Structures

- `Writer`, `Reader`, and `Book` types are defined to encapsulate the attributes of each entity.
- `HashMaps` are used to store and manage books, writers, readers, comments, and feedback efficiently.
- `Buffers` are utilized to maintain a dynamic list of writers.

## Functions

- `addWriter`: Adds a writer and their book to the system, updating the book catalog and comments accordingly.
- `addReader`: Records a reader's book choice and feedback, influencing the visibility of their interactions based on their preference.

## Installation
This system exemplifies the use of the actor model in Motoko to manage stateful interactions in a decentralized environment. It showcases the potential for building community-driven platforms on the Internet Computer.
To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with bounty_project, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd bounty_project/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
